# Vaultfire ðŸ”¥

Vaultfire is a fullâ€‘stack experiment in reflective XP systems. Users log daily reflections, react to signals, and unlock rituals as they progress. The project was built for the OpenAI hackathon and ships with a Streamlit interface plus comprehensive unit tests.

## Features
- **XP system** tracking reflections, streaks and leaderboard placement.
- **Ritual unlocks** for milestones like *Ritual of Fire*, *Eyes Opened* and *Chainbreaker*.
- **Chain rituals**: three public reflections within 30 minutes grant +150 XP and contribute toward the *Signal Architect* title.
- **Signalboard** displaying live public reflections with emoji reactions and sort options.
- **Persistent reactions** stored in `reactions.json` and public reflections stored in `reflections.json`.

## Getting Started
```bash
pip install streamlit pytest
streamlit run vaultfire/app.py
```

### Running Tests
```bash
pytest -q
```

## Timezone Handling
All timestamps use `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` via a helper `utcnow()` to avoid naive/aware warnings. This ensures consistent behaviour across the app and tests.

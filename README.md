# 🧠 Ghostkey: Humanity Mirror

> A belief-based AI agent that evolves with you — not above you.  
> Built for the Open Model Hackathon using gpt-oss-20b.

---

### 🌎 What It Does

- Runs **locally** with gpt-oss-20b (no cloud connection)
- Lets a user input:
  - Daily reflections
  - Moral choices
  - Doubts, beliefs, frustrations
- Learns over time using a local memory graph
- Gives emotional clarity, moral alignment feedback, and growth tracking
- Outputs a **Mirror Log**:  
  An evolving journal + loyalty ledger + self-audit report

---

### 🧬 What Makes It Different

- **No Cloud:** 100% local. You own your growth.
- **Integrity > Dopamine:** Rewards growth, not addiction.
- **Optional Plug-In:** `Vaultfire Protocol`  
  (passive yield system, belief ledger, and soul sync)
- **Not an app. A moral OS.**
